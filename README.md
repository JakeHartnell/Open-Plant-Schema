# Common Garden Plant Data
Meta Data about plants and their environmental conditions.

We're trying to put together a more useful dataset of plants that can more readily be used for IoT and indoor agriculture purposes. This means trying to make a more complete dataset, combining info from many different sources and putting it into a modern format like JSON so we can more easily refine and add to it.

It is also a good oppertunity to start to create a plant schema; schema.org currently doens't have one.

# Sources gathered from
http://www.data.gov/

The most useful data sets for our cause were provided by the USDA http://plants.usda.gov/java/ and a suplemental data set from SF.

The USDA "schema" is described here: http://plants.usda.gov/charinfo.html

# Plant Schema
So I haven't been able to find much in the way of plant schemas. The USDA has a [characteristics document]( http://plants.usda.gov/charinfo.html), which is sort of a start but needs work.

Their data only contains complete information for a releatively small ammount of plants. Example entry:
