# Common Garden Plant Data
Meta Data about plants and their environmental conditions.

We're trying to put together a more useful dataset of plants that can more readily be used for IoT and indoor agriculture purposes. This means trying to make a more complete dataset, combining info from many different sources and putting it into a modern format like JSON so we can more easily refine and add to it.

It is also a good oppertunity to start to create a plant schema; schema.org currently doens't have one.

# Sources gathered from
Currently in the repo we have a .csv containing a bunch of useful data from the USDA and an .xsl from a group in San Francisco that put together a list of plants to help with the California drought.

Both of these were collected from: http://www.data.gov/
